A simpler library for multi-agent computation in JavaScript



JavaScript offers workers, but they are rather annoying to use.
Dart offers essentially the same model, but with a nicer API.
Erlang offers a more featureful model that also handles errors
and failures. 

The objective of this library is to offer an Erlang-style model
of agents, with the simplicity of JavaScript, a nice API comparable
to that of Dart and the power of web workers.

Very much a work in progress.
